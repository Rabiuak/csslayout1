	<h1>Small Basic and Programming</h1>
	<p>
		Computer Programming is defined as the process of creating computer software using programming
languages. Just like we speak and understand English or Spanish or French, computers can understand
programs written in certain languages. These are called programming languages. In the beginning there
were just a few programming languages and they were really easy to learn and comprehend. But as
computers and software became more and more sophisticated, programming languages evolved fast,
gathering more complex concepts along the way. As a result most modern programming languages and
their concepts are pretty challenging to grasp by a beginner. This fact has started discouraging people
from learning or attempting computer programming.
Small Basic is a programming language that is designed to make programming extremely easy,
approachable and fun for beginners. Small Basic’s intention is to bring down the barrier and serve as a
stepping stone to the amazing world of computer programming.
	</p>

	<h1>The Small Basic Environment</h1>
	<p>
		Let us start with a quick introduction to the Small Basic Environment. When you first launch SmallBasic,
you will see a window that looks like the following figure.
This is the Small Basic Environment, where we’ll write and run our Small Basic programs. This
environment has several distinct elements which are identified by numbers.
The Editor, identified by [1] is where we will write our Small Basic programs. When you open a sample
program or a previously saved program, it will show up on this editor. You can then modify it and save if
for later use.
You can also open and work with more than one program at one time. Each program you are working
with will be displayed in a separate editor. The editor that contains the program you are currently
working with is called the active editor.
The Toolbar, identified by [2] is used to issue commands either to the active editor or the environment.
We’ll learn about the various commands in the toolbar as we go.
The Surface, identified by [3] is the place where all the editor windows go.

		<h2>Our First Program</h2>

		<p>b) WriteLine</p>
		<p>c) “Hello World”</p>

		<h2>Our Second Program</h2>

	</div>

	<h1>Our First Program</h1>
	<p>
Now that you are familiar with the Small Basic Environment, we will go ahead and start programming in
it. Like we just noted above, the editor is the place where we write our programs. So let’s go ahead and
type the following line in the editor.
TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")This is our first Small Basic program. And if you have typed it correctly, you should see something
similar to the figure below.
Figure 2 - First Program
Now that we have typed our new program, let’s go ahead and run it to see what happens. We can run
our program either by clicking on the Run button on the toolbar or by using the shortcut key, F5 on the
keyboard. If everything goes well, our program should run with the result as shown below.
Figure 3 - First Program Output
Congratulations! You have just written and run
the first Small Basic program. A very small and
simple program, but nevertheless a big step
towards becoming a real computer programmer!
Now, there’s just one more detail to cover before
we go on to create bigger programs. We have to
understand what just happened – what exactly
did we tell the computer and how did the
computer know what to do? In the next chapter,
we’ll analyze the program we just wrote, so we
can gain that understanding
	</p>

	<h1>Saving our program</h1>
	<p>
If you want to close Small Basic and come back later to work on the program you just typed, you can
save the program. It is in fact a good practice to save programs from time to time, so that you don’t lose
information in the event of an accidental shutdown or a power failure. You can save the current
program by either clicking on the “save” icon on the toolbar or by using the shortcut “Ctrl+S” (press the
S key while holding down the Ctrl key).
	</p>

	<h1>Understanding Our First Program</h1>
	<h2>What really is a computer program?</h2>
	<p>
A program is a set of instructions for the computer. These instructions tell the computer precisely what
to do, and the computer always follows these instructions. Just like people, computers can only follow
instructions if specified in a language they can understand. These are called programming languages.
There are very many languages that the computer can understand and Small Basic is one.
Imagine a conversation happening between you and your friend. You and your friends would use words,
organized as sentences to convey information back and forth. Similarly, programming languages contain
collections of words that can be organized into sentences that convey information to the computer.
And programs are basically sets of sentences (sometimes just a few and sometimes many thousands)
that together make sense to both the
programmer and the computer alike.
